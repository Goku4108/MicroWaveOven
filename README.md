# MicroWaveOven
This is a microwave oven simulation done on PicSimLab. Embedded C is being used to program this oven. Microchip's 8-bit PIC16F877A microcontroller is used to control the processes. Coding is done via MPLab X IDE and compiled through XC8 cross compiler. This project is being done under the guidance of Emertxe.

The MicroWaveOven.X.production.hex file is to be loaded to the PicSimLab, after Cleaning and Building the Project Files over MPLab X IDE.
